      <p>Music Macarons is a website where anyone with a computer and space on their device can create computer generated music, download, and then do what they want with it. You are able to use the <i>Quick Create</i> option where music is generated with preset values; easy for anyone in a rush. You also have the option to use <i>Custom Create</i>, where you have the chance to move around some nobs and click some buttons to influence the generation.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that this website might, no, will most likely spit out something that isn&#39;t to everyone&#39;s liking. But hey, have fun with it. I try my best and there will be updates for both the website and the inner workings of this black magic. If it ends up sounding unbelievable (either good or bad), feel free to send it my way at <i>circidalia@gmail.com</i> where i&#39;ll feature both you and the music on my MusM YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>Or spread it around the internet, either works :D</p>

      <p class="question">Why did I create this?</p>
      <p class="answer">- Well, as a senior at BRPS, I am required to create anything I want as a final project. Something this ambitious seemed like the perfect way to kick-start my way into the real world and show what I am really capable of. I should also mention that this project combines my two main interests in life: technology and music. It&#39;s a bridge between the two subjects that many people haven&#39;t taken, and I plan to take it as far as possible.</p>
      <p class="question">How did I come up with this idea?</p>
      <p class="answer" id="end">- Video Games! To be specific: a dungeon generator video game I had been working on before this project. When I received the notification on Google Classroom about this project, I really didnâ€™t know what to do. After a few weeks of working on my video game, I realized I could make a music generator as well. This idea was further strengthened by a challenge to create a music generator by Codecademy once I finished their Python lessons. And shortly after, someone gave me the idea to make this into a website, which intrigued me to the point where I decided this would be my final project.</p>
